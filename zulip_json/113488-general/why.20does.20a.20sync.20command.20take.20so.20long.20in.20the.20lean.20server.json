In the editors, these messages just update the progress bar on the side so there's no need to be super fast.</p>",

This is really only an issue when I’m trying to interact with Lean in a tight loop.  For example, I send something to Lean, see if it works, and based on that send something different to Lean.  Anyway, it is annoying but not that big deal since the applications I have in mind can either get around the delay by putting multiple commands in the same file or just live with the delay.  Also the language server has larger issues that create more headache for programatic interaction with lean than this delay.  Thanks for the answer.</p>",
