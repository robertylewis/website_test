<p>Hi, do we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_intersection_theorem" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_intersection_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_intersection_theorem</a> ? It should be easy to formalize but I want to avoid reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>I don't think so. It should be in <code>subset_properties.lean</code> hence easy to find.</p>
