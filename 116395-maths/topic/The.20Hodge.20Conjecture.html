That would be a cool thing to do.</p>

<p>Quite far I would say. I have smooth manifolds (over R or C or whatever) and their tangent bundles, but not its exterior powers. This shouldn't be hard (shouldn't be easy either, by the way). But there is no cohomology yet, no long exact sequences, no snake lemma, and so on. And I haven't done anything on submanifolds either (next step on my TODO list is the local inverse theorem).</p>

<p>Heh, I guess we could benefit from a library on homological algebra and sheaf cohomology first (-;</p>

<p>Also, do you want to assume a proof of the Hodge theorem, or do you want to prove it as well? Because I don't know cheap proofs there.</p>
