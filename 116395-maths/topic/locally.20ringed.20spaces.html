<p>In particular, at the moment <code>stalk_at</code> is just defined by:</p>

<p>Unfortunately general colimits of rings are pretty gross. My plan had been to construct coequalizers and coproducts in CommRing,</p>

<p>However if you do that, it's going to be very hard to show that a stalk of the structure sheaf is actually germs of continuous functions at that point.</p>

<p>I think I'll need to change <code>colimit</code> in the definition of <code>stalk_at</code> to <code>directed_colimit</code> (or <code>filtered_colimit</code>?), show that the poset of neighbourhood of <code>x</code> is actually directed, and then separately give a formula for directed colimits of commutative rings.</p>

<p>That formula for directed colimits, when applied to the sheaf of continuous functions, should look exactly like germs.</p>

<p>But if someone wants to do parts of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>define filtered categories, and filtered colimits</li>
<li>construct instances of <code>has_coproducts</code>, <code>has_coequalizers</code>, and/or <code>has_filtered_limits</code> for <code>Ring</code></li>
<li>show that continuous functions from a topological space to a topological ring forms a topological ring</li>
<li>define germs of continuous functions</li>
<li>show that germs are a local ring<br>
then it will get done faster. :-)</li>
</ul>
