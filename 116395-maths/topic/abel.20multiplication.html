<p>It seems that <code>abel</code> works only for <code>add_comm_group</code>, not for <code>comm_group</code>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>, would that be easy to fix?</p>

<p>It would basically need to apply <code>additive</code> to turn it into a multiplicative problem</p>

<p>Is it something you may do in the near future?</p>

<p>not today. I'll look into it</p>

<p>How would applying <code>additive</code> in a proof work in practice? I tried to do this a few months ago (so can't really remember how it went) but the only way I could get to work reliably in a use case where I wanted to be in tactic mode was to add the lemma</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">lemma</span> <span class="n">to_add</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">has_mul</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="bp">@</span><span class="n">has_mul</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">mul</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">_</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="bp">@</span><span class="n">has_add</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">additive</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">_</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">rfl</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and <code>rw to_add</code> as needed, which I liked because it wasn't too many extra characters, but is there a proper way?</p>

<p>The intended use is to write out the desired statement directly, and apply the corresponding multiplicative theorem and have defeq work out the differences. <code>algebra.group_power</code> has a few examples with <code>multiplicative</code></p>
