<p>I just added a PR which is way too big. I don't mind if it stays there forever, but in compensation I would be very happy if <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/821" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/821">#821</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/829" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/829">#829</a> could be merged in the near future :) This is a good opportunity to test mergify, right?</p>
