<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238446">@Anne Baanen</span> has made a really nice PR with the definition of bilinear forms. At some point in the theory, you need to konw that <code>2</code> is invertible in the base ring. We need to make a design choice here. I would like to have some more eyes and brains on this code. Will the current approach play well, or should we try something else?</p>

<p>½ is such a fundamental thing. Maybe it even makes sense to add a type class specifically for this.</p>

<p>I agree. Characteristic different from <code>2</code> is an assumption that shows up really often (notably when dealing with quadratic forms :)</p>

<p>I like the notation!</p>
