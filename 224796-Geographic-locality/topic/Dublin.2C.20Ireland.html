<p>Top of the morning to you. <span aria-label="shamrock" class="emoji emoji-2618" role="img" title="shamrock">:shamrock:</span>️</p>
<p>I’d love to talk to anyone interested in mathlib here in Dublin.</p>

<p>Hi, I am in Dublin also, but my knowledge or Mathematical Logic and Lean is just pretty basic. I played a little bit with Lean some months ago translating basic Propositional and First Order Logic to Lean.</p>

<p>That's marvellous, I'm not on my own here in Dublin. I guess with the <span aria-label="locked" class="emoji emoji-1f512" role="img" title="locked">:locked:</span> <span aria-label="down" class="emoji emoji-2b07" role="img" title="down">:down:</span> geographic location doesn't really matter but even still, I'd love to hear if you are involved in any Lean / Mathlib work.</p>

<p>For my part, I am extremely interested in the Mathlib project, so I try to contribute bits and pieces to that when I have time.</p>

<p>Hi Oliver, thank for your message. <br>
Sadly I am not involved in Mathlib, I wish, but my knowledge is too basic. I am just learning some basic Type Theory and Lambda Calculus.</p>
