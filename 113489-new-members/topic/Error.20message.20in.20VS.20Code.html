<p>In tactic mode if there is an error, it lists the current tactic state with n goals, and then the error, followed by the tactic state again. Is there a setting to make it show the error first? Currently I have to scroll down to see the error every time I change something.</p>

<p>Some might say that if you have to scroll down then you have too much in your tactic state :-)</p>
