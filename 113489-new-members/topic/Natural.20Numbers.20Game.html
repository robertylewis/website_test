<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>I've defined the following helper because it turned out to be necessary. My first question will end up being "why was this necessary?".</p>

<ol>
<li>Why did I have to define <code>add_comm'</code> to get the <code>rw (add_comm' b a) at h_1</code> to stick? I couldn't simply rewrite by <code>add_comm b a</code>.</li>
<li>How can I make the recursive call to <code>eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self h1</code>? I'm getting "unknown identifier" at the moment.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think playing the natural number game off-line is so well supported. Your first issue is probably a conflict between mathlib's add_comm and the one Kevin crafted for the game. The second issue is simply not what proofs by induction look like in Lean. This should be all explained if you play the game online;</p>

<p>Can you post code which compiles? i.e. let's assume I have got a local copy of the game. Can you give me something I can cut and paste, with the imports and opens you're using? You shouldn't need to define add_comm' and if I can't easily reproduce your errors it's hard to help (I've just spent a few minutes trying and I've failed)</p>

<p>The natural number game tries very hard to stop notation leaking through, this looks like your problem. The natural number game was written precisely because Lean's <code>induction</code> tactic was very poor with regards to leaking notation. You are seeing precisely the problems which I saw my users see when they were trying to write the game themselves.  <code>injection f</code> is not a natural-number-game-sanctioned tactic and it looks like you have managed to create a hypothesis h_1 which mentions <code>add a b</code>. You should <code>change &lt;write what h_1 should actually say, i.e. change add to +&gt; at h_1</code>. Notation leakage is a big problem if you try to do things yourself, and I don't explain this sort of thing at all in NNG.</p>

<p>The underlying issue going on here is that there is something called definitional equality, which means "two things are equal because they have the same definition", and there is something called syntactic equality, which means "two things are equal if they are literally exactly the same string of symbols".</p>

<p><code>rw</code> only works with syntactic equality. <code>add a b</code> is definitionally equal to <code>a + b</code> but not syntactically equal to it.</p>

<p>The <code>change</code> tactic can be used to change anything to something definitionally equal. It works on hypotheses and goals.</p>

<p>Oh that's interesting about Agda. The whole <code>[nat_num_game]</code> stuff is my attempt to stop notation being leaked like this, but as you can see it's a pretty difficult task. Because basically I'm trying to teach mathematicians to rewrite, leakage is a killer. Lean's inbuilt <code>induction</code> tactic always returns the exact constructors used to define the type, and when <code>mynat</code> is defined, we don't have access to notation.</p>

<p>Hence <code>induction</code> by default will give <code>mynat.zero</code> and <code>mynat.succ</code>, and already <code>mynat.zero</code> is enough to stop <code>zero_add</code> working, because <code>0</code> is notation, but it's notation for <code>has_zero.zero</code>, which is defeq to <code>mynat.zero</code>. <code>rw</code> can see through notation, but it's the <code>mynat.zero</code> not being <code>has_zero.zero</code> which causes no end of confusion to maths undergrads.</p>

<p>The <code>[nat_num_game]</code> monad modifies certain core tactics by basically doing all of those <code>change</code>s to get things back to the canonical notation needed for the rws to work and look good, but it's not a "whatever the user does, fix stuff up" thing, it's literally just explicitly modifying the behaviour of certain core tactics like <code>induction</code> and <code>cases</code>.</p>

<p>I think one thing that's interesting about the community here was that I am a mathematician and I had the idea about the game when trying to get undergrads to just write Lean files to prove stuff like this about a home-rolled nat, and then when I realised there was this notational leakage issue I asked for help and the community stepped in fixed it by showing me how to make my own tactic monad, and then when I realised that mathematicians weren't going to be downloading lean I asked for help and the community stepped in again with all this web framework stuff, there are all these people in the background without whom it would never have got off the ground. This is why this chatroom is such a cool place to be.</p>

<p>The online NNG is a great learning tool, but there are a number of things that work in a different way than in a local Lean installation. Even <code>rw</code> for example; it does not close a goal in NNG, but otherwise it does so. It might be a good idea to collect such changes in a "disclaimer" list for this and other such games that are bound to spring up, although with Lean 4 in the works this may not be the best time.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266440">@Shing Tak Lam</span>  Sure, these are good in their own right. What I meant, though, was that the online game pages could themselves host an additional summary page, more or less formal, of changes made to the usual tactics. Given the work that the game designer logs in anyway, it is a little unfair to ask them for any extra bit. It would save us (the players) from some later surprises though, although figuring stuff out is eventually part of the bigger game.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm having trouble in the natural number game, to be precise advanced multiplication world.<br>
For example I proved the first level like this:</p>
<p>theorem mul_pos (a b : mynat) : a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → a * b ≠ 0 :=</p>
<p>cases b with n,<br>
intro h,<br>
cc,<br>
intros ha hn,<br>
cases a with a,<br>
cc,<br>
apply succ_ne_zero _,</p>
<p>So I "understand" most of my proof (and by that I mean I expected cc to be able to close the goals when I used it, even though I can't inspect what exactly it did).<br>
But I'm puzzled about the last line - I didn't expect the proof to be complete after this (for lean).<br>
Could someone explain why?</p>

<p><code>ha</code> and <code>hn</code> are equivalent to true, they are not very useful hypotheses - it holds vacuously that <code>succ n \neq 0</code> - your conclusion in your current goals is similar (1 + k) * (1 + n) cannot possibly be 0 for <code>k n \in mathbb{N}</code>, no matter what the context contains; what Kevin alluded to with definitional equality is something like this:</p>

<p>Maybe I should add that the last conclusion before <code>apply succ_ne_zero _</code> is now <code>succ ((a + 1) * n + a)</code>, which fits the lemma "more obviously".</p>

<p>I don't think that mathematicians are interested in the difference between definitional equality and "normal equality", whatever that means, but what is going on here is that <code>a + 1</code> is <em>by definition</em> <code>a + succ 0</code> which is <em>by definition</em> <code>succ (a + 0)</code> which is <em>by definition</em> <code>succ a</code>. It is not a coincidence that you have to prove <code>zero_add</code> in NNG and you don't have to prove <code>add_zero</code> -- in fact <code>add_zero</code> can be thought of as an axiom, defined when addition is defined. But <code>zero_add</code> needs to be proved by induction. This way of thinking about <code>+</code> is extremely asymmetric and very counter-intuitive to a mathematician's model of addition, so I don't stress this at all. The <code>change</code> tactic changes a goal to a <em>definitionally</em> equal goal so it is in some sense a very  unmathematical tactic -- it will change <code>a + 0</code> to <code>a</code> but it won't change <code>0 + a</code> to <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>There is still some mathematical content in saying that a + 0 = a by definition while 0 + a = a is a theorem (if you define addition by induction on the second argument).</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I was making my way through level 6 of inequality when I stumbled on something that has me a bit confused. I was able to finish the level, but the following code that I used to do so bothers me.</p>

<p>I apologize in advance for my uninformative variable names. Why is it that <code>have h := eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self </code> expects an expression of the form (a b : mynat), but <code>have h2 := add_right_eq_zero</code> expects a proposition? More specifically, why can't I write <code>have h := eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self uhba</code> without lean whining like I did with <code>have h2 := add_right_eq_zero h1</code>?</p>

<p>If my understanding of what I learned in proposition world is correct, lean treats implications like <code>eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self</code> as functions from proofs to proofs, so why can't I write <code>have h := eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self uhba</code> and obtain <code>h := c + d = 0</code> as a result?</p>

<p>With () brackets, Lean expects you to tell it the input. With {} brackets Lean decides it will guess from the context.</p>

<p>Level 15 of inequality world says, "By default, the definition of a &lt; b in Lean, once ≤ is defined, is this: <code>a &lt; b := a ≤ b ∧ ¬ (b ≤ a)</code>". Why doesn't lean simply define a &lt; b as <code>a &lt; b := ¬ (b ≤ a)</code>? Is it for the convenience of easily obtaining  a ≤ b from a &lt; b?</p>

<p>I think it is because all relation <code>≤ </code> are not total !  For example,   the relation <code>  ⊆  </code> on subset of a set <code> X </code>.  If we take  <code> X = { 0,1}</code>  and the relation  <code>  ⊆  </code>on the subset of  <code>X</code> we  have   <code>¬  {1} ≤ {0} </code> and you don't want to tell that <code> {0} &lt; {1} </code> ! It's ok for the relation where all element are comparable.</p>

<p>Do you know when this will be ready? Using Lean to gamify undergrad math is a fantastic idea</p>

<p>Level 7 of inequality world says "Note that you can do things like have h2 := add_right_eq_zero _ _ h1 if h1 : a + c = 0."  What exactly do the underscores do here? The level doesn't give any more details beyond that note, and this is my first time seeing them in the game.</p>

<p>The underscores mean that Lean should try and infer those arguments, in this case add_right_eq_zero has type</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">lemma</span> <span class="n">add_right_eq_zero</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">mynat</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but we can see that if we apply add_right_eq_zero with <code>a c h1</code> as arguments where <code>h1</code> has type <code>a+c = 0</code> then the first two arguments (<code>a</code> and <code>c</code>) aren't strictly needed, theres only one possible thing they can be given the type of <code>h1</code>  for everything to make sense, so the underscores tell lean to work out those arguments automatically.</p>

<p>In this case theres not a huge amount of savings (you only have to type one character anyway), generally it saves us from having to retype long complicated terms sometimes,  which can also improve readability, or from having to remember which way round arguments go. And it can make it easier to change variable names later or copy lines to different contexts.</p>

<p>But I think this is a bit confusing actually, as in the latest version of the natural number game the arguments for add_right_eq_zero are always implicit (this was changed only recently) so depending on which version is live for you it may be that you never needed to type <code>add_right_eq_zero a c h1</code>.</p>
