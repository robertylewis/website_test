<p>Am I right in thinking that PR's from non-master branches of mathlib are for some CI reason preferred to PR's from forks? If so, and if this isn't going to change any time soon, what is the preferred way to get someone like <a href="https://github.com/shingtaklam1324" title="https://github.com/shingtaklam1324">https://github.com/shingtaklam1324</a> added to the list of people who are allowed to write to non-master branches of mathlib? Usually I just ask Rob but I am reluctant to pester him every time and it's only him and Simon who I know for sure can do it. Who can do it?</p>

<p>I've just sent him an invite. The list of people who should be able to do it is at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib#maintainers" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib#maintainers">the bottom of the mathlib README</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, for future requests, I just set up a "Zulip user group" so that you can ping all of the mathlib maintainers like this: <span class="user-group-mention" data-user-group-id="2494">@maintainers</span> .</p>
