<p>I can modify an existing syntax highlighting mode to make it work properly..."</p>

<p>"Regarding code editor syntax highlighting, I haven't found a good highlighting. Maybe we can create one for codemirror, though. Is there a simple language definition, where we for example can get a concise list of all keywords? I also checked what they are doing for that online live "lean" editor. This interface is based on the "monaco" editor [1]. They seem to have written their own plugins for it. CoCalc doesn't use Monco, but CodeMirror, though."</p>
