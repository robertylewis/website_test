<p>So am I right in thinking that if my students want the latest mathlib goodies, they are going to have to keep updating Lean? In particular I'll have to train them to do something different to "leanpkg upgrade"?</p>

<p>You'll need to teach them <code>leanproject upgrade</code>. Right now it doesn't upgrade Lean itself but we could easily make that possible. Of course this will work smoothly only they have elan and mathlib-tools.</p>
