<p>Suppose I've formalized the axioms to incidence geometry as a typeclass in Lean and I now want to formalize the axioms to affine incidence geometry (incidence + parallel postulate). Which of the following is considered more elegant: 1) using <code>extends</code> on a class or 2) define the entire class from scratch and use instance chaining to derive a typeclass instance for incidence geometry given any affine incidence geometry?</p>

<p>I don't know what instance chaining but it sounds like a way to manually achieve the same result as 1</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="264734">@Donald Sebastian Leung</span> I guess that (1) is the way to go.</p>
