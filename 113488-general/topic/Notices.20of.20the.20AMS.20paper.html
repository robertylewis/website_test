<p><a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/computers.pdf" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/computers.pdf">Here</a> is the current version of my paper for the Notices of the AMS. They would like a final version by 1st May, 1 week from today. Any comments, however brutal, would be welcome.</p>

<p>NB I am not shouting about this paper on Twitter or anything yet -- this is a preliminary version (indeed there's still a TODO on p7 -- it would be great to hear from some people who know the state of analysis/geometry in Lean and who could supply some juicy theorem names if they're in master.</p>

<p>Some examples from <code>analysis</code>: analytic functions, C^r functions, mean value theorem and friends, uniqueness of a solution of an ODE, inverse function thm and implicit function thm (PRed, hopefully will land before May 1st).</p>

<p>Lean’s tactic state can often be easily understood by mathematicians without any specialist knowledge of ITP’s, because the notation used is standard mathematical notation.</p>

<p>Maybe add a link to the Codewars website, when you first mention it?</p>

<p>In your discussion of gaps, you might mention that we have measure theory, but no applications to probability theory/stochastics. Combinatorics and graph theory is under construction.... but lots of gaps there.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Thanks for mentioning Codewars in your paper!</p>
<p>I've skimmed through the first one and a half pages and found a typo (or is it a pun?) on page 2. Near the end of subsection 1.1, it says, "At this stage in the development of mathematics, every proof can be chased right down to the axioms of the system we are considering, and students are expected to <em>lean</em> from such courses that mathematics can be done in this way." I suppose it should say "learn"?</p>
