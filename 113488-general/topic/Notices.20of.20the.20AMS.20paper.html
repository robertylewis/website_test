<p>NB I am not shouting about this paper on Twitter or anything yet -- this is a preliminary version (indeed there's still a TODO on p7 -- it would be great to hear from some people who know the state of analysis/geometry in Lean and who could supply some juicy theorem names if they're in master.</p>

<p>In your discussion of gaps, you might mention that we have measure theory, but no applications to probability theory/stochastics. Combinatorics and graph theory is under construction.... but lots of gaps there.</p>

<p>I've skimmed through the first one and a half pages and found a typo (or is it a pun?) on page 2. Near the end of subsection 1.1, it says, "At this stage in the development of mathematics, every proof can be chased right down to the axioms of the system we are considering, and students are expected to <em>lean</em> from such courses that mathematics can be done in this way." I suppose it should say "learn"?</p>

<p>I'm used to backwards reasoning since I'm more used to proving theorems in an ITP than on paper (my paper proofs are often unnecessarily long and verbose), but, strangely, I also initially thought the same as you did.</p>

<p>About the Lean example on pages 5-6 about the composition of two injective functions, perhaps it would be better to add a trailing comma to the last tactic invocation (<code>assumption</code>)? I would imagine that someone new to Lean stepping through the proof after clicking on the link might be confused that (s)he cannot see the "no goals" message right after the <code>assumption</code> since the theorem is already proven at that point.</p>
