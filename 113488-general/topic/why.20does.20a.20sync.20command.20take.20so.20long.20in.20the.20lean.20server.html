<p>In the lean server, if you send a sync command, e.g. even a one line file, and wait for the server to finish syncing (i.e. wait for a a current tasks response with no tasks), it will take about 0.2 seconds.  Why?  That seems really long in computer time.  Is it intentional?</p>

<p>To be more specific, if you send, say,</p>

</pre></div>


<p>then the time it takes to get back</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;message&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;file invalidated&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;response&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;seq_num&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">}</span>

</pre></div>


<p>is about .2 seconds.  (This is assuming you have already warmed up the server by sending it many requests.)</p>

<p>The intention behind that delay was to limit the number of messages from the server to the client.  With the delay, you get at most 5 messages per second.  If you'd send a message every time the server has done something, then there'd be a lot more messages.  In the editors, these messages just update the progress bar on the side so there's no need to be super fast.</p>

<p>Yeah, this question is really a consequence of the fact that a number of us are trying to basically hack the language server capability of lean to create a way to programmatically interact with lean.  This is really only an issue when I’m trying to interact with Lean in a tight loop.  For example, I send something to Lean, see if it works, and based on that send something different to Lean.  Anyway, it is annoying but not that big deal since the applications I have in mind can either get around the delay by putting multiple commands in the same file or just live with the delay.  Also the language server has larger issues that create more headache for programatic interaction with lean than this delay.  Thanks for the answer.</p>

<p>Yes, we are clearly bending the tool here. But this is not a bug, this is a feature. One of the motivation for my work on <code>lean-client-python</code> is that someone will hopefully soon start working on Lean 4 server mode, (and hopefully that someone is reading Zulip) and I hope to provide input about what users may want besides what we already have.</p>

<p>If you want to interact with Lean in a tight loop, then my suggestion would be to write your own server as a Lean program.  Just a small read-eval-print-loop that accepts the commands you want.</p>

<p>Yeah, if I understand your use case(s) (ML?) correctly, you should have much better and fine-grained options in Lean 4 such as playing your own elaborator than anything superficial you can do via a server API</p>

<p>Sebastian, what you say seems fair, but there are still people who will want to interact with Lean from another programming language, building interactive interfaces that don't look like a text editor, hence my experiment with Qt (which comes from a real project by Frédéric and Florian).</p>
