<p>I hereby invite you to <a href="https://www.codewars.com/?language=lean" title="https://www.codewars.com/?language=lean">sign up for an account on Codewars</a>.</p>
<p>Codewars is a training platform where programmers of all disciplines train on code challenges called kata in order to improve their programming skills, and <strong>we are now extending our invitation to Lean users of all levels (whether beginner, intermediate or expert) and disciplines (mathematicians and computer scientists alike) interested in computerized theorem proving</strong>.</p>
<p>Lean support has been recently added to Codewars (late March / early April) and is now in the <em>Beta Phase</em> - we now have much more content compared to when we just started thanks to all of those who actively participated in the Round 1 invitation and generously contributed Lean kata to our site, but we are still looking forward to potential feedback on how the experience on Codewars can be improved (for Lean).</p>
<p>In terms of Lean challenges, we now have <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=false" title="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=false">11 approved kata</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=true" title="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=true">20 beta kata</a> spanning topics on synthetic geometry, category theory, number theory, abstract algebra ... and more! Feel free to browse through the list of available challenges and train on whatever challenge you find of interest. Once you have 25 honor (a scoring system on Codewars), you will also be able to vote on Kata you have completed based on how satisfied you were with the experience, so <em>don't forget to cast your votes</em>! <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-263a" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> </p>

<p>How does beta work? More specifically, how many votes does a beta kata need to get before begin approved?</p>



<a name="193868443"></a>
<h4><a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Invitation%20to%20join%20the%20Codewars%20Lean%20community%2C%20Round%202/near/193868443" class="zl"><img src="http://robertylewis.com/website_test/assets/img/zulip2.png" alt="view this post on Zulip"></a> Donald Sebastian Leung <a href="http://robertylewis.com/website_test/stream/113488-general/topic/Invitation.20to.20join.20the.20Codewars.20Lean.20community.2C.20Round.202.html#193868443">(Apr 14 2020 at 09:05)</a>:</h4>
<p>Generally, the number of satisfaction votes, rank assessments as well as the satisfaction rating required for a Beta kata to leave Beta decreases as 1) the average assessed rank of the kata is higher and 2) you get more and more kata approved. For example, if you currently have &lt; 10 approved kata and the average assessed rank of your Beta kata is in the <code>7-8 kyu</code> range then it will require 12 (satisfaction + ranking) votes with a satisfaction rating of &gt;= 80% in order to be eligible to leave Beta, but if its average assessed rank is <code>1-2 kyu</code> then it only requires 5 votes and &gt;= 70% satisfaction to leave Beta.</p>

<p>I mean if you put it into Codewars, the preloaded.lean should fail the tests and the completed solution should pass. So if that's the case then you're probably fine? Probably best to ask someone who actually knows this stuff (Donald)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds about right, except that the initial solution should only fail the tests because of a wrong input (or in the case of Lean, a <code>sorry</code>) and not because of a compilation error. We don't want the solver to perform unnecessary debugging just to get their solution to compile. There are exceptions where the initial solution is designed to not compile (e.g. in a weird C++ kata involving compile-time metaprogramming) but those are extremely rare.</p>

<p>Not sure if it's related here but I should probably mention this: there is a known long-standing bug on Codewars that when you publish your kata for the first time, the servers do not actually check if your kata is completable so can actually publish a broken kata that no one can possibly solve. But on every re-publish, the servers do the checking and prevents you from re-publishing if the kata becomes un-completable. The best way to ensure that you do not accidentally publish a broken kata is by clicking "Validate Solution" and making sure that the test output is green before publishing your kata.</p>

<p>IMO the two good things about authoring theorem-proving kata (as opposed to ordinary programming kata) on Codewars is 1) authoring a theorem-proving kata takes about the same effort as solving one, whereas authoring a programming kata requires substantially more effort in designing suitable fixed, edge and random tests and 2) the community generally give more favorable votes to theorem-proving kata (if only because there currently aren't that many and everyone wants to see more on the site), whereas, when authoring a programming kata, if you don't get it <em>just right</em> then you immediately get <del>cyber-bullied</del> shouted on by the community for all sorts of various issues and receive a flood of "Not Satisfied" votes (which could automatically retire your Beta kata, rendering it impossible to leave Beta).</p>

<p>IMO it's easier to allow <code>N</code> to be real since otherwise one may have to round their value of <code>N</code> up to the nearest natural number in Lean after finding it by manipulating the inequality <code>abs (x n - l) &lt; ε</code> on paper. But I am definitely no expert in analysis / Lean so feel free to leave your suggestions in the discourse of the kata concerned and I'll see if I can implement your suggestions in my spare time.</p>

<p>Yeah, sorry about that, I don't think Codewars supports TeX / MathJAX or similar so I had to typeset the LaTeX in an external editor, take screenshots of the rendered output, upload them onto imgur and paste the images there.</p>

but if there is dark mode and light mode in the settings, that could fail, since you either choose the text colour for the LaTeX to be black or white.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might be able to convert LaTeX into HTML and then put it in the page. I haven't used pandoc before, but I've heard it's a very powerful tool.

<p>BTW how easy would it be for a typical undergraduate mathematician to define "transport lemmas" between the general definition of a limit in mathlib and my specialized version and solve the kata by riding on results already proven in mathlib?

<p>The first kata I was shown was the verified Horner's rule one and the second one was tail-recursive sum. Now that I look closer the second one uses a function but even if it used a list, it would literally be "set x = 1 in Horner's rule" but I think it's still easier to reprove it than to use the proof of Horner's rule.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's often considered a bad idea to accept translations to languages when the difference in the difficulty between translations is significant.</p>
<p>For example, sorting a list of numbers in ascending order would be <code>8 kyu</code> in most languages but around <code>4 kyu</code> in <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" title="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck">BF</a> so the recommended approach is to keep them two separate kata instead of making a BF translation to the existing <code>8 kyu</code></p>

<p>Rather than requiring katas to state the definition of a limit a certain way or use a mathlib API that may advantage users with more library knowledge, we should have theorems proving the equivalence of mathlib's limit to a number of basic versions of it. That way you can convert your hypothesis to mathlib form in one line</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> you mentioned my choice of Kata questions. Elementary number theory is a great source of questions which are easy to state but can be very hard to prove. I am just trying to come up with kata for which you have to know some number theory techniques in order to do the maths, and then there's still a challenge of formalising it in Lean within the time limit (16 seconds sounds like a lot but I am not convinced that their test servers have got too many cores...).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> To be honest I feel a bit trolled by your katas. It's probably a difference in mentality, but I almost never do formal maths problems where I don't already more or less know the answer in regular maths. For me the interesting challenge is in figuring out how to structure that understanding into something that the computer will like. In programming katas I would think it is the same way; you are given a task, and you the programmer don't have any trouble understanding the task but your job is making the computer understand it too.</p>
<p>With your maths puzzles, it's more like solving a Putnam problem, followed by a formalization problem. Which is fine as far as it goes, but somehow doesn't feel like "what I signed up for". My ability to come up with a good formal proof now depends on also coming up with the right mathematics, and here I don't think I can beat the many hundreds of years of effort already spent in this direction by others. Now I'm sure that most of this is your intent, I know you like maths puzzles like this, but I wonder whether it would be better to offer a solution or at least a pointer to where someone can learn the necessary tricks to solve the maths part of the problem to return the focus to the coding part (on a site like Codewars).</p>

<p>Mario I completely agree with what you're saying, it is not at all clear how to do these hard number theory questions in maths. The reason I'm setting them is simply because as someone with a background in number theory and in Olympiad training as well as some Lean knowledge I am in a good position to be able to write Kata of this form. I can quite imagine that people like you will find them extremely hard for non-lean reasons but fortunately there are 40 Lean Kata out there not set by me and you can stick to them. I'm just offering something completely different because I know there are professional mathematicians out there who look at Putnam and IMO problems when they come out, and might be tempted to look at these too. You can often find the maths solutions by googling, and for the ones you can't perhaps a stackexchange question will appear or whatever. I'm intentionally offering something different, intended to appeal to different people to the usual.</p>

<p>By the way, I didn't want to suggest that I can't do them, I have some math competition background too ;) But I would not be surprised if your kata have extremely low solve rates, because you are probably targeting the wrong audience (which is to say, a different audience than the one that frequents the Codewars site).</p>

<p>I guess as a side comment, my kata statements would be trivial to translate into e.g. Coq, but to get them onto Codewars you'll have to offer a Coq solution so you'll have to find a Coq version of me, and encouraging a Coq version of me to exist would be something else that I'd consider a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I see that we now have 51 Lean Kata in total.</p>
<p>I saw someone moaning (on the codewars gitter chat maybe?) a week or two ago that it was silly to support all these obscure beta languages which had &lt; 100 kata, and at the time it occurred to me that perhaps Lean would end up as one of those languages. But 50 is a respectable number and it would be great to get it up to 100. If anyone has any quirky little maths questions which they have solved themselves in Lean and would like to see as a kata, they should feel free to get in touch with me and I can stick it up on the site and give them attribution. I am typically solving one kata a day at the minute, in the evenings after my day job is done; yesterday I proved that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">SL_2(\mathbb{N})</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">L</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.30110799999999993em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> was a free monoid on 2 generators in Lean (modulo an application of Euclid's algorithm which is left implicit in the question).</p>
