<p>Hello,<br>
Is there anyone else currently interested in inner product spaces? I'd like to start working on this.</p>
<p>I found this formalization: <br>
<a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/inner_product_spaces/basic.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/inner_product_spaces/basic.lean">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/inner_product_spaces/basic.lean</a>.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120943">@Andreas Swerdlow</span>  Are there still plans to bring this into mathlib?</p>
<p>I am also aware of the Lean2 formalization: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/library/theories/analysis/inner_product.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/library/theories/analysis/inner_product.lean">https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/library/theories/analysis/inner_product.lean</a></p>
<p>The ImperialCollege formalization is over complex numbers and the Lean2 formalization is over the reals. I am interested in the reals, but I will try to find a generalization that subsumes both. Are there any concepts like this already?</p>

<p>There is the whole theory of quadratic forms, which works over any field (though characteristic 2 can be hairy).</p>

<p>Then you can specialise to nondegenerate forms, symmetric forms, alternating forms, hermitian forms, etc...</p>

<p>In number theory we define unitary groups in the setting where K is a field (say) and L/K is a finite etale K-algebra of degree 2, which is a fancy way of saying either L=K+K or L is a separable quadratic extension of K. The non-trivial K-automorphism of L is denoted c, say (c for complex conjugation if K=real and L=complex) and then one can consider a non-degenerate hermitian sesquilinear form on an L-vector space. For it to be positive definite you need some notion of positive though, so then K should embed into the reals.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks. I'll see what I can do.</p>

<p>I was thinking of submitting to mathlib fairly soon. A more up to date version is available here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-fork/mathlib-backup/blob/inner_product_spaces/linear_algebra/herm_inner_product_space.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-fork/mathlib-backup/blob/inner_product_spaces/linear_algebra/herm_inner_product_space.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-fork/mathlib-backup/blob/inner_product_spaces/linear_algebra/herm_inner_product_space.lean</a></p>

<p>I have transferred the Lean2 formalization to Lean3 now. It's for real vector spaces only. Let's see if we can merge after you submit to mathlib.</p>
