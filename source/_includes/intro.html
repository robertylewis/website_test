        {{ site.author.name }}. I'm a postdoc in the
      department of Theoretical Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working with
      Jasmin Blanchette on the Matryoshka project.</p> 

      <p>I completed my PhD in Pure and Applied Logic at Carnegie Mellon University, under the
         supervision of Jeremy Avigad. I earned an MS in Logic, Computation, 
         and Methodology in 2014 and an MS in Mathematics in 2015, both from CMU. Previously, I 
         earned a BA from Rice University with a double major in Mathematics and Philosophy, and 
         taught geometry, pre-calculus, and AP calculus at St. Agnes Academy in Houston. </p>
      
      <p>My interests revolve around formal methods, logic, and the foundations of mathematics. 
        I work on interactive theorem proving, formal verification, automated logical reasoning, 
        and type theoretic foundations for mathematics. More details are available on my Research
        page.</p>
