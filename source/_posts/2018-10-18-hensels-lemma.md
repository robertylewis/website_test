Here you will find the supplementary materials to [my paper](padics.pdf) *A formal proof of Hensel's
lemma over the p-adic integers*. This paper was published at CPP 2019. For more information, contact

### The Formal Development

The project described in the linked paper has been incorporated into the Lean
[mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/) repository. The current state of the p-adic number
development can be found in the directory
[/data/padics/](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/tree/master/src/data/padics). See also the pull
requests [here](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/337) and
[here](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/262).

Since mathlib is regularly updated, we preserve a branch
[here](https://github.com/robertylewis/mathlib/tree/padics_paper) that shows its state when this
paper was written.
