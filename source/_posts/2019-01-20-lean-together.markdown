From the 7th to the 11th of January, 2019, we hosted a workshop [Lean
Together](https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/) in Amsterdam. This workshop was meant to
serve a few purposes. First, it was a meeting for Lean developers and users who have been working
remotely on the system and [mathematics libraries](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). Second,
it was a kickoff party for Jasmin Blanchette's [Lean Forward](https://lean-forward.github.io/) NWO
project. A key part of this project is "mathematical outreach"; we want to put proof assistants in
the hands of mathematicians, and through collaboration with computer scientists, advance the world
of formal mathematics.

The workshop was an incredible success on both fronts. When we started planning in July, we expected
to have around 30 participants; we ended up with 68 people registered. Amazingly, 29 self-identified
their primary discipline as mathematics, and 29 as computer science. (Nine chose the
"multidisciplinary" option and one wrote in "logic.") It was great to meet more of the Lean crowd in
person, and equally great to see the crowd eager novice formalizers.

We're still feeling the momentum from this meeting and we hope to keep things rolling. Watch out for
an announcement about Lean Together 2020: this time, it's in Pittsburgh.
