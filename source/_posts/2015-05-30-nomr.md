In 2015 I tought a course at Carnegie Mellon titled *The Nature of Mathematical Reasoning.* This
course, aimed at non-mathematicians, took a philosophical look at the historical and modern practice
of mathematics. The course materials can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/80110).

I haven't transferred the course materials to my new website design yet. This page is to preserve a
link from the main site to the materials.
