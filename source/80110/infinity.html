    <h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>

    <h2>Questions about infinity</h2>
    <h3>Due Wednesday, April 8</h3>

    Think about the following questions before Wednesday's class. You don't need to write up or turn in your answers, but we'll be discussing them: be prepared!<br><br>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Suppose that S and T are two finite sets. What does it mean to say that S and T have the same number of elements?
      <li>What does it mean to say that S and T are finite?
      <li>Can you think of an example of a set (either in the language of set theory we showed in class, or just an intuitive "collection" of things) that is infinite? How do you know it's infinite?
      <li>Are all infinite sets the same size?
    </ol>
