    <h2>Homework 9</h2>
    <h3>Due Monday, April 20</h3>

    <ol>
      <li> Give an example of a finite set S, and an infinite set T such that S is a subset of T.
      <li> Is your infinite set T from the previous problem countable or uncountable? Explain!
      <li> Give an example of a countable set that we did NOT discuss in class (ie, not the natural numbers, integers, or rationals). Explain why it is countable.
      <li> Recall that the intersection of two sets A and B is the set of objects that are elements of both A and B. If S and T are countable sets, is it possible for their intersection to be uncountable? If S and T are uncountable, is it possible for their intersection to be countable? Explain!
      <li> The symbols &cup; (union) and &cap; (intersection) look a lot like the logical symbols for or and and, respectively. Recall that in propositional logic, the identities (A & (B v C))  <=>  ((A & B) v (A & C)) and (A v (B & C)) <=> ((A v B) & (A v C)) hold. If we replace v with &cup; and & with &cap;, what do these identities say about sets? Are they still true? (Hint: think about sets as Venn diagrams. If A and B are circles, A &cap; B is the area inside both A and B.)
