    <h1>80-110: The Nature of Mathematical Reasoning</h1>
    <h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
    <h2>Spring 2015</h2>
    <h2>Homework 6</h2>
    <h3>Due Friday, Feb. 27</h3>

	Take the Chapter 2 quiz on OLI. (Note: this counts as a homework grade, not as a quiz!) I only care about the following questions: #1, 2, 5-13, 16, and 24. You can answer whatever you want on the others, or leave them blank; I'll ignore them when I enter grades.<br><br>
	
	In addition, do the "Chase Truth up the Parse Tree" and "Determine the Truth Value" labs in the Chapter 3 problem set on OLI. (To find these, click on "Problem Set" next to "Chapter 3 Lab," let the Java applet open, and then click on "Chapter 3: Semantics.")

<br><br>On this assignment, and all homeworks on OLI, you're welcome to refer back to the text while working. You're also allowed to "retry" the quiz once if you're unhappy with how you did the first time; I'll take the higher grade.
