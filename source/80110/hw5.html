    <h1>80-110: The Nature of Mathematical Reasoning</h1>
    <h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
    <h2>Spring 2015</h2>
    <h2>Homework 5</h2>
    <h3>Due Friday, Feb. 20</h3>

	Take the Chapter 1 quiz on OLI. (Note: this counts as a homework grade, not as a quiz!) I only care about the following questions: #2, 3, and 6-12. You can answer whatever you want on the others, or leave them blank; I'll ignore them when I enter grades.<br><br>

On this assignment, and all homeworks on OLI, you're welcome to refer back to the text while working. You're also allowed to "retry" the quiz once if you're unhappy with how you did the first time; I'll take the higher grade.
