### Logic and Modeling, Period 5, 2020

The COVID-19 edition of Logic and Modeling is entirely online.

I find the video navigation page on Canvas difficult to use, so I'm adding links to the videos for the lectures here as I record them.

When I have time I'll gather more materials for the general public;
at the moment, this is for my VU students only!
