<p>I am investigating using Lean to specify and verify protocols, and then code-generate the protocols in another language (say Go).<br>
In that regard, I am wondering if there is a way to export a complete Lean program's AST in some common format (like JSON/ProtoBuf/etc.)?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>That is not currently supported. How would you use that information?</p>

<p>What is supported however is parsing <code>olean</code> files (object files) and extracting the definitions from there. A prototype exists in Rust and it's called <code>rs-olean</code></p>
