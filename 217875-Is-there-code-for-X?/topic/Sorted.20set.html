<p>Assume I have a subset of <code>fin n</code> of cardinality <code>k</code>. I would like to get the increasing map <code>fin k -&gt; fin n</code> that parameterizes it. Is it already in mathlib? Otherwise, my approach would be first to do it for infinite subsets of <code>ℕ</code> (to avoid dealing with emptiness issues and <code>option</code>), and then reduce to this case by extending my subset of <code>fin n</code> to a subset of <code>ℕ</code> by filling on the right, and then taking the first <code>k</code> elements of the resulting parameterization on <code>ℕ</code>. But I guess some people might complain that this approach does not compute well...</p>

<p>You can <code>sort</code> a finset, and then use <code>nth</code> to get the elements in numeric order. There is a bit of plumbing to make the domain <code>fin k</code> specifically but not too much, especially if computation doesn't matter</p>
